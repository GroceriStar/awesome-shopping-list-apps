#### basic functionality of grocerylist app

Registration/login. It should be also possible to use an app without registration. But to be able to synchronize lists on various devices or to share them with family members or friends, users should have an account. Facebook login or registration via email can work pretty fine for the first version of the app.
 
Main menu. When it comes to the menu, there are several options on how it can be introduced to users in a shopping list app. It can work as a start screen or can be provided in a tab bar (more common for iPhone users) or in a side menu.
Inventory of all shopping lists. The list of all user’s lists may sound a little awkward, however, people often need different products for different occasions (B-Day party, home, grocery store, etc.).
 
Shopping/grocery list itself. Being a core feature of the application it definitely should include:
- Adding items (quantity, additional notes);
- Sorting items (alphabetically, from newest to oldest and vice versa);
- Marking items as "complete" or "incomplete”;
- Deleting items (delete one/all);
- Moving items (move items to another list, copy items).
 
Suggestions. Auto-suggestions of items can be very convenient especially for “typing on the go” users.
 
List sharing. The ability to share lists makes shopping with family members and friends much easier as it allows you to instantaneously see list updates made by others.
 
Push notifications. Push notifications informing users when someone has shared a list with them, updated it, started or ended shopping can facilitate synchronization and make the process more efficient.
 
Archive. In order not to be overloaded with various lists, it is good to be able to archive old ones but still have a possibility to check or reuse them in the future.

`Update: Since I wrote this post two years ago, I’ve changed up my system. The big change is adding an Amazon Echo to our kitchen/living room. I’ve then linked up the built-in Echo shopping list feature to my Trello board with IFTTT. Sure, I don’t get the neat feature of having all the items ordered and grouped according to where they are in the store, but it’s just so easy to look in the fridge/freezer/cabinet and shout out the things that are needed. (I just wish there was a verbal shortcut for “Alexa, add [thing] to my shopping list.” Sure, I can say “Alexa, buy more [thing].” But then I might accidentally order something from Amazon.)`
